# CO2 Emissions Prediction

This project focuses on predicting CO2 emissions from vehicles using a Simple Linear Regression model. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various vehicles, including their engine size, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- `Make`: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
- `Model`: The model of the vehicle.
- `Vehicle Class`: The class of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, Sedan).
- `Engine Size(L)`: The size of the vehicle's engine in liters.
- `Cylinders`: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
- `Transmission`: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
- `Fuel Type`: The type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel).
- `Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption in the city.
- `Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption on the highway.
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)`: Combined fuel consumption.
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)`: Combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon.
- `CO2 Emissions(g/km)`: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer.

### Model Building

- A Simple Linear Regression model is built to predict `co2` emissions using `engine_size`.
- Train-test split is used to evaluate the model.
- Model evaluation includes metrics such as R-squared, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and residual plots.

### Outlier Analysis and Skewness

## Future Work

- Explore more complex models such as Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.
- Feature engineering to create new features from existing data.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
